# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a professional software developer, currently located in Berlin, Germany. I am interested in learningðŸŒ± new skills, new technologiesðŸ¤– and new programming
languagesðŸ‘¾ where ever I can. I am also fascinated by Machine Learning, which I first got in touch with back in 2016. Since 2019 I am working as a Machine
Learning Engineer in the Automotive and Consulting industry. In my free time I am working on a variety of different fun projects.
